        <p>Nordic skiing today is far less common than alpine skiing.
            its most popular version is "cross-country" skiing
            which entails skiers traveling long distances utilizing their skis.
            Cross-country skiing is a popular olympic sport, it also has
            World Ski Championships held every odd number year.
